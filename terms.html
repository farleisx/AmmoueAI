        <section>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>Ammoue AI</strong> ("Ammoue", "we", "our", "us"). By creating an account, making a purchase, or using our AI-powered website builder, you are entering into a legally binding agreement to follow these Terms of Service.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>1. Service Overview</h2>
        <p>Ammoue AI provides artificial intelligence tools to generate, edit, and deploy websites. We facilitate hosting through third-party services like Vercel and handle data via Google Firebase.</p>

        <h2>2. Account Security & User Conduct</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials (Email, Google, or GitHub).</li>
            <li>You must not use Ammoue AI to generate content that is illegal, fraudulent (phishing), defamatory, or malicious.</li>
            <li>Sharing account access with unauthorized third parties is strictly prohibited.</li>
            <li>You must review and verify all AI-generated code and content before publishing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Payments, Pro Plan & Refunds</h2>
        <p>Ammoue offers a "Pro" upgrade for a one-time fee. This provides lifetime access to the service as it exists and evolves.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> Due to the immediate delivery of digital credits and the costs associated with AI generation, all sales are final. By clicking "Pay," you waive your right to a refund unless required by mandatory local law.</li>
            <li><strong>Credits:</strong> Daily usage limits for Pro users are refreshed every 24 hours. Unused credits do not roll over.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Safety:</strong> Payments are handled exclusively by PayPal. We do not store your financial information.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-clause">
            <h2 style="margin-top:0;">4. Absolute Right to Terminate & Remove Content</h2>
            <p>To keep our platform safe and secure, Ammoue AI maintains <strong>Absolute Discretion</strong> over all accounts and content. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> We may suspend or permanently delete your account at any time, with or without a specific reason, and without prior notice.</li>
                <li><strong>Project Removal:</strong> We reserve the right to unpublish or delete any website, deployment, or project you have created if we believe it violates our policies or poses a risk to our infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>No Liability:</strong> Ammoue AI is not liable for any loss of data, loss of business, or loss of revenue resulting from such terminations or removals.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property & AI Ownership</h2>
        <p>Ammoue AI owns the underlying technology, AI templates, and platform code. You are granted a non-exclusive license to use the output generated for your own personal or business purposes. However, Ammoue AI reserves the right to provide similar designs, layouts, and code structures to other users of the platform.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>Our service relies on Google Firebase (Database/Auth), PayPal (Payments), and Vercel (Hosting). Your use of Ammoue AI is simultaneously governed by their respective Terms of Service. We are not responsible for downtime or data loss caused by these third-party providers.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability & Indemnity</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Ammoue AI is provided "as-is." We make no guarantees regarding uptime or accuracy. You agree to <strong>indemnify</strong> (protect) Ammoue AI from any legal claims or expenses (including lawyer fees) arising from the content you publish or your use of the service.</p>
